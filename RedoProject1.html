    <p>Born and raised in Corpus Christi, Texas. I love being active, whether it's outside tending to my small vegetable garden or inside playing Barbie's with my daughter. I'd prefer a Saturday spent out and about than inside lying around watching TV (totally not trying to make anyone feel bad if that is what you enjoy). </p>
    <p>Creating jewelry for women and men is also something I do in my spare time. I wire wrap personally picked out crystals, gems and stones in copper or silver. It is something not to many people around this area are into or even understand why, of all things, I have taken an interest in creating these pieces of artwork using natural minerals.</p>

    <p>It is something I was drawn to when I met this woman, I'll just call her "D", from Philadelphia back in 2016. Never in my life had a met a more spiritually connected person. After hearing her speak about the happenings of the current world, I noticed she was wearing the most breathtaking piece of rose quartz wrapped beautifully in a silver toned wire. I was fascinated with it, with her. Every since that day, have been making my own to wear and then some for other people who appreciate the meaning behind my pieces.   </p>
